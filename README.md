PART 1
Directions on using GIT,gitHub and webstorm.

*****GIT***** is a VCS (Version Control System) used for code management and GitHub is website that offers online repository services.
You can use git withuot GitHub but you cannot use GitHub without git. Webstorm is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) used for coding in JavaScrript, HTML, CSS.
Webstorm lets you managed Git projects hosted on GitHub directly from the IDE:***clone***, repositories, etc.
Step by Step on how to use Git, GitHub & Webstorm.

1. Install Webstorm [https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows],Git[https://git-scm.com/download/win] and create a github account on Github.com.
2. Connect ***GITHUB*** with webstorm. add GitHub password to Webstorm when prompted.
3. Create a ***REPOSITORY*** in GitHub clicking the sign in the upper right corner.
4. Create a repository from webstorm by select VCS and import into Version Control.
5. Create a Webstorm file. click on File > New > HTML file.
6. Add files to ***GIT***.
7. ***COMMIT*** your changes.
8. ***PUSH*** change to ***REMOTE*** repository.
9. The files are now on GitHub.
10. Set up GitHub pages by clicking Settings and checking the repository name.
11. Choose a GitHub page location. Select "Master ***BRANCH***"
12. You can create a new branch in webstorm by clicking  on the branches pop-up,  choose new branch.

* Branch -a new / separate version of the main repository. branches allow you to work on different paths of a project without impacting the main branch.
* Clone - a full copy of a repository, including all logging and version files.
* Commit - keep tarck of progess and changes as we work. Git Consider each commit a change point or "save point".
* Fetch - gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo. On your local Git, fetch udpates to see what has changed on Github.
* GIT -  is afree and open source distributed code managemenet and version control. In addition to software version control, Git is used for other applications including configuration management and content management.
* Github - is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking and collaborating on software projects. it enables developes to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers to upload their own code files to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.
* Merge - combines the current branch, with a specfied branch.
* Merge Conflict - an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
* Push - used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is a how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
* Pull - is a combination of fetch and merge. it is used to pull changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.
* Remote - a remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is  a Git repository thats hosted on the internet or another network.
